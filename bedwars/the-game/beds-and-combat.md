# Beds and Combat

PvP is enabled within twenty seconds of the game starting, and remains on throughout the entire game unless the **regular PvP cooldown** setting is enabled. Friendly fire is not enabled in bedwars.

If a person is knocked off into the void, they will respawn, unless:

* Their team's bed has been destroyed
* The game has reached deathmatch

{% hint style="info" %}
If you leave the game when your bed is destroyed, or if your bed is destroyed while out of the game, you will rejoin the game as a spectator.
{% endhint %}

## Destroying a bed

To destroy a bed, simply break it with your fist. It cannot be broken by fireballs, TNT, arrows, pop-up towers, or anything that isn't a direct action by the player themselves.

{% hint style="info" %}
If at any point you become stuck in blocks, simply type `/unstuck`.
