# Islands

Around the map, there are various islands, with some that spawn rarer materials and allow buying of later-game items.

## Home Islands

These are where the player's spawnpoints, iron and gold summoners, main shops and beds are located.

### Upgrades

Various upgrades can be applied to your island.

#### Alarm

This trap sets off an alarm whenever a non-team member enters the island, invisible or not. However, once the trap is set off, it must be rebought.

#### Speed

#### Haste

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This effect applies everywhere, across the whole map.
{% endhint %}

Gives Strength I to all players from that home island, allowing them to attack with heavier hits. Cannot be upgraded.

## Diamond Islands

These islands spawn to the sides of the home bases. Diamond summoners are shared between two teams, and as such can provide easy and sneaky access to another team's base.

Diamond summoners spawn at a slower rate than home summoners, but twice every game they get upgraded. You can't just bank these however; if there is no-one within a ten-block radius of the island, then they can only spawn a maximum of four diamonds.

## Emerald Centre Islands

In the middle of the map, there is one big island with four emerald summoners. Going into this area often involves encountering other people and either fighting or running from them.

Emeralds spawn at the slowest rate, but like diamond islands are upgraded twice every game.

Also featured at the very centre of the map is the enchanting and special item stations:

### Enchanting Station

This shop allows you to quickly enchant any items available. To enchant, you need two things: emeralds and lapis lazuli. Lapis Lazuli can be earned by killing other players, earning one for every player you kill.

Some enchants can be also be upgraded.

### Special Item Station

This shop stocks interesting items like Golden Apples, Iron Golem spawn eggs, Fireballs and more. These items vary in cost, and are risky to get as it is a target for many people attacking.
