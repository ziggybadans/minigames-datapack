# The Game

## Objective

Bedwars is a game about the balance between defending, attacking and patience. Four teams of four, six teams of three or eight teams of two aim to destroy the other's beds to knock them out of the game, while protecting their own. There's a variety of upgrades, blocks, weapons, armour and other interesting items to help them achieve that goal before sudden death, where all beds are destroyed.

Playstyles differ from person to person, and there are many different ways to play the game, this is simply one very generic way.

## First Moments

As soon as the game starts, the number one goal is to protect your bed.

Some players like to immediately go for the offensive and try and rush others before they aren't ready, and this can work, but is risky especially with under three teammates, **and is not the perfect strategy.** Many games can be won by taking it slow and defending, and playing it this way can often can result in a fun and thrilling game.

## Diamond Summoners Activate

After a minute of playing, the diamond summoners will be active. Throughout the game, they will upgrade twice at regular intervals.

## Emerald Summoners Active

After about three minutes, the emerald summoners activate. Like the diamond summoners, they will upgrade twice at regular intervals.

## Deathmatch

After 20 minutes of playing, deathmatch will initiate. **All beds are destroyed,** and the sky turns dark. The players now have 10 minutes to try and win, or it will be a draw.
