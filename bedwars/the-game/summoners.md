# Summoners

At every base, there are summoners: two in four-player, one in three- and two-player. These initially will spawn iron ingots, which can be used to buy basic blocks, weapons and amour.

They spawn on a repeating timer, giving a constant supply of materials. If two players stand under a summoner, no more will spawn; the players have to share.

## Upgrades

Summoners can be upgraded to gold, diamond, and eventually emerald. Each summoner material can also be upgraded three times for faster drops.
