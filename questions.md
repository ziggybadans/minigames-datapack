## Why the name Glass?

This minigames datapack is meant to be as transparent as can be. First off, it's a datapack, so it is directly supported in vanilla using official commands and no altering of code. Secondly, it's made to be as optimised as possible, so that it can use very little server resources. Finally, everything is customisable by the user, and does not interfere with anything outside of the minigame itself.

## Why a datapack?

Many may consider datapacks to be inferior to plugins and mods, and to an extent, they're right. They do not offer the kind of base level resources as plugins do, and are limited heavily by what is in the game already.

However, Minecraft is a game with many differing levels of knowledge and playstyles, and some don't know or don't want to download Spigot, edit config files and run a dedicated server - some simply want to hop on with their friends in a LAN world or Realm and play minigames.

This datapack allows them to do that, and also allows much easier customisation to any of the code than a plugin or mod. You don't need a decompiler, or a code editor: just a simple text editor like Notepad++ or even the built-in one will do fine!
